challenges
Task 1:
For this task, you are to write a Python code that takes as input a string
representing a user's name. Your program should output the length of the name
and the number of times each vowel occurs in it. See the below example:
What is your name? John Sam
There are 8 characters in your name.
The number of times 'A' occurs in your name is 1
The number of times 'E' occurs in your name is 0
The number of times 'I' occurs in your name is 0
The number of times 'O' occurs in your name is 1
The number of times 'U' occurs in your name is 0


Task 2:
For this task, you are to write a Python code that asks for a string and a search
word. The program then determines and displays how many times the search
word appears in the string.
Note: For this question, a “word” is simply taken as a sequence of characters,
which may occur as a “stand-alone word” or part of another word.


Task 3 
For this task, you are to write a Python code that displays the triangle of a given
size similar to the one shown for the example below. If the size is 5, for example,
the following triangle is displayed:
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *  
* *
*

Task 4 - 
For this task, you are to write a Python code that calculates the balance of a long-
term savings account after applying compound interest for a number of years.

INPUTS: Amount Interest Years
        1000    1.5       0
        1000    1.5       5
        2500.4   2        7
        
EXPECTED OUTPUT: Balance
                  1000
                  1077.284004
                  2872.173643
                  
                  
               
               
Task 5 - 
For this task, you are to write a Python code that asks the user to enter 2 or more
integers as a string, to be entered on one line, separated by one zero. If there are
more than one zero, then these will be a part of the number. The program then
finds the even numbers, computes and prints out the average. See the below
example:
num = input("Enter your number: ")
Assume the user entered “2040304405”, then the summation of even numbers is 2+4+44=50,
and the average is 50/3=16.6
                  
                  
  Task 6 
Task 6, Part A 
For this task, you are to write a function, named adjust, that takes a number of
cents between 0 and 9, inclusive, rounds it off to the nearest 5 cents by the
following rules, and returns the result:
 1 and 2 cents are rounded off to 0
 3, 4, 6 and 7 cents are rounded off to 5
 8 and 9 cents are rounded off to 10 cents .
INPUT EXPECTED OUTPUT
1       0
4       5
8       10                



Task 6, Part B 
Part B depends on your solution to Part A, so make sure that you complete the
parts in order.
Write a function, named roundOff, that takes an amount of money in dollars, and
rounds it off to the nearest 5 cents and returns the result. The amount is entered
as a decimal number with 0, 1 or 2 decimal places. The rounding off is based on
the rules given above.
INPUT EXPECTED OUTPUT
1.34    1.35
3.46    3.45
123.41  123.40
123.42  123.40
123.43  123.45
123.44  123.45
